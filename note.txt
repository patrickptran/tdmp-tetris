Let's build a Tetris game together! I'll be covering how to build a Tetris clone from scratch using JavaScript and React. In this video I walk through what the game includes, what the different pieces involved are, and what systems we will need to implement.This is a great chance to build a complete game from scratch. It's also a good way to learn a lot of React fundamentals and how to organize code. Some features we'll use include, functional components, useState, useEffect, useCallback, memo, custom hooks, and keyboard input.
